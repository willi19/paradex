.. py:function:: triangulate(corners: numpy.ndarray, projections: numpy.ndarray)

   Triangulates 3D points from multiple camera views.

   :param corners: (N, 2) matrix where each row is a 2D image coordinate from a camera.
   :param projections: (N, 3, 4) matrix where each row is a camera projection matrix.

   :returns: (1, 3) matrix containing the triangulated 3D point.
   :rtype: kp3d


.. py:function:: ransac_triangulation(corners: numpy.ndarray, projections: numpy.ndarray, threshold=1.5, iterations=100)

   RANSAC-based triangulation to filter out outliers.

   corners : Nx2 matrix (N cameras, 2D image coordinates)
   projections : Nx3x4 matrix (N cameras)
   threshold : Inlier threshold for reprojection error
   iterations : Number of RANSAC iterations

   :returns: (4, 3) matrix with filtered 3D keypoints
   :rtype: best_kp3d
